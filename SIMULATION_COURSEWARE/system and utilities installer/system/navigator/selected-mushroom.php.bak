Generally, some kinds of stimuli are needed for the shift from mycelial (vegetative) growth to the fruitbody formation (reproduction) phase. These stimuli include abrupt changes in temperature, humidity, gas concentration, light and nutrient reserves, and physical stimuli. Among them, a sharp temperature drop is the most effective in fruiting induction for most mushrooms. Fruiting is induced by low temperatures ranging from 10 to 15Åé in P. ostreatus and P. eryngii. However, the fruiting of P. florida, P. sajor-caju, P. cornucopiae and P. cystidiosus is less affected by temperature</td></tr>".

Pleurotus florida belongs to the family Basidomycetes. Basidomycetes play an important role in nature by recycling Carbohydrate through lignin degradation by the white - rot Basidomycetes is achieved through lignolytic enzymes such as laccase, lignin, peroxidase, and Magnesium peroxidase. The nutrional requirements and the limits of the physical environment for mycelia growth and fruiting have been investigated for many Pleurotus sp. Recent studies have indicated that cotton waste also a good substrate for the cultivation of Pleurotus sp.</td></tr>".
