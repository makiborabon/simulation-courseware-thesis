Basidomycetes play an important role in nature by recycling Carbohydrate through lignin degradation by the white - rot Basidomycetes is achieved through lignolytic enzymes such as laccase, lignin, peroxidase, and Magnesium peroxidase. The nutrional requirements and the limits of the physical environment for mycelia growth and fruiting have been investigated for many Pleurotus sp. Recent studies have indicated that cotton waste also a good substrate for the cultivation of Pleurotus sp.</td></tr>".
